## On the PC/Host

### 1. Pair with your phone
```
bluetoothctl
scan on
pair <PHONE-MAC>
trust <PHONE-MAC>
exit
```

You can check with: `bluetoothctl info <PHONE-MAC>`


### 2. Bind a virtual serial port

Run (replace <PHONE-MAC> with your phone’s address):
`sudo rfcomm bind /dev/rfcomm0 <PHONE-MAC> 1`

1 is the channel number (SPP channel).

You can verify it’s listening with: `ls -l /dev/rfcomm0`

Now your PC sees the Bluetooth link as a serial device.

3. Start gpsd on that port

`sudo gpsd /dev/rfcomm0 -n -N`

Then test with: `cgps -s`

## On the Phone (Termux side)

### 1. Ensure Bluetooth permissions

```
termux-setup-storage
termux-bt
```

### 2. Run your NMEA streamer over Bluetooth

Use rfcomm (Termux package: pkg install bluez) or socat to open an RFCOMM socket and send NMEA.

If your phone acts as the server, run:

`rfcomm listen hci0 1`

This opens channel 1 and waits for a connection from your PC.

Then pipe your GPS data into it:

`./send_gps_nmea.sh rfcomm 1`
